|Service provider|An entity operating blockchain-based services|
|Blockchain-based service | A service partly or completely leveraging blockchain technologies, such as smart contracts |
|Consensus node | A node forming the consensus network that is responsible for batching transactions into new blocks and confirming them using a Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) consensus algorithm |
|Ranger node | A node consistently downloading newly created blocks from the CNs and gossiping about them among themselves while storing a local copy of the blockchain|
|Full node | A node containing all the blocks generated from a blockchain|
|Region | A set required for Klaytn operation consisting of CNs and RNs|
|Regionchain | A chain designated to manage region checkpoints and operational data|
|Servicechain | A service-provider-owned blockchain capable of running more than one blockchain-based service|
|Segment | An abstract space storing service-chain-specific transactions|
|Consensus container | An abstract space storing segments|
|CNN (consensus node network) | A permissioned peer-to-peer network of consensus nodes|
|RNN (ranger node network) | A permissionless peer-to-peer network of RNs|
|PoP (proof of participation) | A series of processes designed to ensure correct RN behaviors|
|PoR (proof of replication) | An algorithm designed to prove that an RN has successfully (and honestly) replicated and persisted all blocks|
|PoSC (proof of serving clients) | An algorithm designed to ensure that an RN is reachable on the public network (e.g., the Internet) to serve client requests|
|Enterprise proxy | Service-provider-friendly proxy SDK powered by Klaytn|
|DApp | Decentralized Application|
|KLVM | Klaytn Virtual Machine|
|Unit price| A fixed price of gas maintained by Klaytn |
