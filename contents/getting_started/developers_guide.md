This chapter is for people who want to contribute to Klaytn source code. If you just want to run Klaytn, you don't need to read this. This document will be the entry point for developers of the Go implementation of Klaytn. Developers here refer to the hands-on: who want to build, develop, debug, submit a bug report or pull request or contribute code to klaytn. When Klaytn source code is ready to open to public, more detailed contents will be updated. Contribution guide will also be written at that moment.
