## General Information
Native coin of Klaytn is called *KLAY*. KLAYs can be used for many purposes such as transaction fee, coin staking and medium of exchange. At genesis, 10 billion KLAY will be generated. There will be additional inflation to reward consensus nodes, ranger nodes and fund Klaytn Improvement Reserve (KIR). Inflation rate is targeted to be lower than Klaytn's economic growth, to protect KLAY holders from explicit dilution cost. 

### Consensus Nodes and Ranger Nodes

Consensus nodes (CNs) are responsible for processing transactions into new blocks and confirming them. To become a CN, a candidate have to stake at least millions of KLAY to protocol. The probability of becoming a block producing committee increases in proportion to the amount of staking. RN will be rewarded through Proof of Replication (PoR) and Proof of Serving Clients (PoSC).

### Klaytn Improvement Reserve

Traditional public blockchain's monetary system does not have a sustainable funding structure to maintain and develop a platform. It hugely undermines the possibility for blockchain platform to continuously evolve in a more complete form. Since technology continues to be developed and what users want is changing, a consistent funding system is required to follow those trends. Klaytn therefore operates the Klaytn Improvement Reserve (KIR) for sustainable ecosystem investment and development.

The KIR can be used for Klaytn ecosystem building and ongoing development. Potential usages of KIR are as follows, and may vary. 
- Investments for DApps
- Source for sustainable development of platform, including security audits and better developer experience
- Funding for eco-related projects, teams to acquire more users
- Community Events, Meetups, Hackathon
- etc.

To prove usability of blockchain technology and reach mass adoption, it is imperative to have so-called _killer DApp_ and other services that normal users can use in their everyday life. Klaytn has been focused on token economy that many blockchain service providers can benefit and feel secure, to accelerate those future. Various token economy models are under development to help service providers to easily build their service on Klaytn, operate their DApp/protocols, and make better user engagement.
