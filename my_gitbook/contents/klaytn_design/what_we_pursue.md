Klaytn is designed to offer exceptionally high performance, solid reliability, stability, low costs, and a security model similar in complexity to that of private blockchains but with entirely open access to allow auditing blocks and far more decentralized trust. On top of competitive performance and security, our team aims to improve usability of Klaytn and allow developers and users to easily adapt and use our platform. To promote better usability, Klaytn provides a blockchain-based application development environment (DES) that is similar to that of traditional application development and an appropriate user interface enabling users to use applications that leverage blockchain technology seamlessly. With expertise in application development and services, we propose the following blockchain design for Klaytn, which we believe is a practical idea that can address usability challenges.

*Disclaimer*: Note that the following design can change at any moment to serve the purpose of Klaytn.  We plan to release technical reports for Klaytn modules, and each report will evaluate the implementation and discuss the rationale behind the module decisions.
